An app for tracking tasks and chores for a group or family. it should be possible to create a task or chore that can be a single occurence or reoccuring daily, weekly or monthly or custom recurrence.. you might specify a time for reminder. the task should have a name and possible description.

a task can be assigned to a single individual or multiple. the task can be marked as should be completed by everyone or one of the assignees.

When completing the task, you should have the option to just mark it as completed, or record a numerical value or text. examples could be tracking weight or body mesurements (numerical) or writing a note (text)

it should be possible to get an overview of completed tasks by month or week. It should be possible to see the numerical values displayed in a nice visualization.

To design a comprehensive task and chore tracking app for a group or family, we can consider the following screens:

Dashboard: An overview of tasks, possibly categorized by "My Tasks," "Group Tasks," or "Upcoming."
Create/Edit Task: A form to define task details like name, description, recurrence (single, daily, weekly, monthly, custom), reminder time, and assignment.
Task Details: A screen showing the specifics of a selected task, allowing for completion, and displaying completion options (mark completed, record numerical value, record text).
Task Completion: A dedicated interface for marking a task as complete, with options to input numerical values or text notes.
Reporting/History: A screen to view completed tasks by month or week, with visualizations for numerical data.
